ðŸŒŸ DynamicArray

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a simple assignment for my Advanced Programming class. It implements a dynamic array in Java, following the DynamicCollection interface,
and provides resizable array functionality and also passes all the tests from Tests file.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Auto-Resizing: The array dynamically expands its capacity when needed.
âœ… Generic Support: Works seamlessly with any reference type T
.âœ… Basic Operations: Supports adding, deleting, retrieving, and updating elements.
âœ… Array Conversion: Easily convert to a standard Java array.
âœ… Exception Handling: Protects against invalid accesses with IndexOutOfBoundsException.

ðŸ›  Implementation Details

ðŸ”¹ Initial Capacity: Starts with a capacity of 8.
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Resizing: Automatically doubles when full.
ðŸ”¹ Efficient Deletion: Elements shift left after deletion to maintain order.
ðŸ”¹ Safe Retrieval: getLast and getRandom return null when the array is empty.
